# Volatility is (Mostly) Path Dependent

Code for the paper https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4174589.

This code contains the functions to:
- Perform the fitting of one model on historical price (see `empirical_study.ipynb`). We show one example on SPX and VIX from Yahoo! Finance data.
- Compute a SPX or VIX vanilla call price using our 4-factor markovian PDV model (see `option_pricing_4fmpdv.ipynb`)
